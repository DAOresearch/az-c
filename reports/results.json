          "reasoning": "The screenshot shows a banner component in its default state with placeholder content. The component displays 'OPZNTUI' (which appears to be a stylized logo/heading) and the subtitle text 'What will you build?' on a black background. This matches the expected outcome of a default state with placeholder children. The text content is present and readable, forming a typical banner/hero section pattern. Given the lenient strictness and that we're only checking text (not layout or colors), this implementation passes the test.",
